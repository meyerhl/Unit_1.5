/**The purpose of this project is to create a Java class called BibleBook
that maintains fields for book name, number of chapters, and a short
summary of the book contents. 

The class should also support displaying a book object in a resonable way.

Test the class by creating 3 instances of it for 3 different books in
the New Testaments of the Bible and then having each of those instances
display itself. 

For example, BibleBook book1= new BibleBook("Matthew", 28, "the gospel of
Jesus Christ"); and then calling book1.display() should show something 
like:
Book Name: Matthew (28 chapters)- the Gospel of Jesus Christ
